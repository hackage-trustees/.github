# Hackage trustees

This organization hosts:
1. Repositories administrated by Hackage trustees on behalf of unavailable maintainers (NMU - non-maintainer upload).
2. The tool [`hackage-cli`](https://github.com/hackage-trustees/hackage-cli) that provides a command-line interface for revising package descriptions on Hackage.
